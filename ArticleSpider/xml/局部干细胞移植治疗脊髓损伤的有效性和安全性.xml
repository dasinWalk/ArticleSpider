      <inclusion_criteria>Clear diagnosis of spinal cord injury and the duration of patients is more than one year.</inclusion_criteria>
      <agemin>24</agemin>
      <agemax>52</agemax>
      <gender>Both</gender>
      <exclusion_criteria>For Group A patients, the exclusion criteria included the following:
(1) inflammation or skin ulceration at the surgical site;
(2) patients with a bleeding tendency or coagulation defects;
(3) patients in poor general condition who could not tolerate surgery and
(4) patients with systemic organ dysfunction who could not tolerate surgery.
To minimize the influence of other factors that could also affect neurological rehabilitation during the assessment of the efficacy of SC transplantation, the following circumstances were also excluded from Group A:
(1) patients with incomplete SCI;
(2) patients who still showed recovery trends in terms of nerve function;
(3) patients with adhesions at the injury site that required surgical intervention;
(4) patients with significant compressive lesions at the injury site that required surgical intervention;
(5) patients with progressive loss of nerve function for unknown reasons;
(6) patients with associated syringomyelia who required surgical intervention and 
(7) patients with associated spinal cord or epidural vascular malformations that required surgical intervention. 
For Group B patients, the exclusion criteria included the following:
(1) patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries;
(2) patients who still showed recovery trends in terms of nerve function;
(3) patients with adhesions at the injury site that required surgical intervention;
(4) patients with significant compressive lesions at the injury site that required surgical intervention;
(5) patients with progressive loss of nerve function for unknown reasons;
(6) patients with associated syringomyelia that required surgical intervention;
(7) patients with associated spinal cord or epidural vascular malformations that required surgical intervention and
(8) patients who could not be in the prone position or who could not remain in the prone position for more than 30 minutes.</exclusion_criteria>
