2. Myeloid malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(except APL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS/MPD)/bone marrow hyperplastic disease, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), all patients were diagnosed through MICM (in accordance with the WHO diagnostic criteria); 
3. All the patients were treated with HSCT; 
4. The primary disease in patients was relapse after transplantation: leukemia cells were recurrence in peripheral blood or &gt; 5% in bone marrow(except for other reasons such as bone marrow recovery, etc.), or extramedullary leukemia cell infiltration or recurrence of molecular biology or genetics; 
5. Karnofsky score 60% or higher, eastern group (ECOG) tumor physical status score 0 to 2 points; 
6. In group 2 weeks before the serum total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 times of normal cap (of the same age group);Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspertate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;=3times of normal cap (of the same age group); Serum creatinine&lt;=2 times of normal cap (of the same age group); Myocardial enzyme &lt; 2 times of normal cap (of the same age group); 
7. Anti-HIV(-);
8. Each participant must sign a consent form (ICF), shows that he/she understand the study purpose and procedures, and are willing to participate in research;Considering from the patient, if the signature is not conducive to patient treatment, it is signed by the legal representative of ICF;
9.Donor selection criteria: the related health donor, no requirement ofHLA matched loci.The relationships between donor and patient include:lineal and consanguineous relation, 3 acting less than about personnel of collateral line and consanguineous relation. </inclusion_criteria>

2. Serious viscera dysfunction or disease, such as serious diseases and function disorder in heart, liver, kidney and pancreas; 
3. Patients with pregnancy; 
4. suffered from II~IV acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD;
5.Systemic corticosteroids should be used in the extraction of peripheral blood, or cell infusion, which was allowed to use in other time periods;
6.Researchers believe that can damage the unnecessary risks to safety, make the results of the study subjects any life-threatening illness, condition or organ system dysfunction; drug dependence; uncontrolled mental disease ; cognitive impairment; 
7. Participants and/or authorized family members refused to accept DNT immune cell therapy; 
8. Participate in other clinical researches in 3 months; 
9. Researchers think that the patient doesn't fit into the group (e.g., patients are expected to be discontinue because of funding problems);
10. The donor does not meet the requirements: HIV positive, active hepatitis B or C, bone marrow disease, onset of mental illness, poison, drug addiction, refused to donate peripheral blood, etc.</exclusion_criteria>
